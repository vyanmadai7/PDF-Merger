### How It Works

1. **Specify folder** containing your PDF files
2. **Name your output** file
3. **Done!** - All PDFs merged and saved in the same folder

Files are automatically sorted alphabetically, so use prefixes like `01-`, `02-` to control the order.

###  Use Cases

- Combine multiple scanned documents
- Merge report chapters into one file
- Consolidate invoices or receipts
- Join split PDF files

###  Requirements

- Python 3
- PyPDF2

### Configuration

The script uses sensible defaults, but you can modify the `merge_pdfs()` function to:
- Filter specific PDF patterns
- Add custom sorting logic
- Include subdirectories

### Troubleshooting

**Error: Folder not found**
- Check the folder path is correct
- Use absolute paths if relative paths don't work

Error: Permission denied

- Ensure you have write permissions in the folder
- Close any PDFs that are currently open

**PDFs in wrong order**
- Rename files with number prefixes: `01-file.pdf`, `02-file.pdf`

```
my-documents/
├── 01-introduction.pdf
├── 02-methodology.pdf
├── 03-results.pdf
└── 04-conclusion.pdf

→ Output: combined.pdf (in my-documents/)
